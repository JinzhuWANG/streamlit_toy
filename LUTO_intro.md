## About LUTO

 - LUTO  estimates Australian land use futures (2010-2100). 
 - Integrating environmental and economic drivers.
 - Considering Global change and policy scenarios.

### How it works?

 - The LUTO model takes an agricultural land use map as the baseline.
 - Combining environmental and economic data to identify potential land use change:
	 - agriculture, carbon plantings, environmental plantings 
	 - biodiversity services , biofuel production *(in LUTO v.1)*
- Corresponding supply of ecosystem services 
	- agriculture, emissions abatement, water resources
	- biodiversity services , biofuel production *(in LUTO v.1)*

### Running detailes
- The model works at a grid cell resolution of 0.01 degrees (~1.1 km)
- At a annual time-step from 2010 â€“ 2100. 
- A Bottom-up model that identifies 
	- location, type, and timing of potential land use change 
- Given changes in the relative profitability of land use options determined by 
	- productivity, prices, costs, and adoption behaviour. 

### Input Parameters
- Carbon price, Energy price, Eood demand, Global outlooks, 
- Biofuel and biodiversity (*in development*)
- Cost of land use transitions and impacts on ecosystem services. 


The 1.0 version of the model is provided here as used to run the 648 scenarios in Bryan et. al. 2015.
